# XRay-Tracing-Data-Filter

Currently in AWS X-Ray, there is no way to filter X-Ray data based on Sub-Segment Data unless it is marked as `Remote`. This python script provides a way to filter through subsegment data to provide results. 



# TODO:
Update Filter Function to allow for general filtering
